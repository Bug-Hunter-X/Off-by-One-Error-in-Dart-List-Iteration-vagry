# Off-by-One Error in Dart List Iteration

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Dart when iterating over a list using a `for` loop. The error occurs because the loop index attempts to access an element beyond the valid bounds of the list.

The `bug.dart` file contains the code with the error.  The `bugSolution.dart` file provides the corrected code.

This example highlights the importance of carefully checking loop conditions when working with arrays or lists in any programming language.
